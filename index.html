The following heatmaps classify Austrian ski resorts based on
the behavior of the resorts' hotel businesses in managing
weather risk. One heatmap measures the firms' exposure to
weather shocks while the other measures their inflexibility in
adapting to changes in weather risk by reducing their operating
leverage. All data points correspond to an Austrian district and
result from information about at least 18 firms. We only
consider districts which contain a municipality less than 25 km
from a ski resort according to Wikipedia's <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Skigebiete_in_%C3%96sterreich">list</a>
of Austrian ski resorts.<br>

heatmap</a>.<br>
<br>
This heatmap depicts a measure of hotel' businesses exposure
to snow risk. The heatmap shows an altitude-adjusted measure
of exposure comparing the effects of snow shocks on hotel
businesses in ski resorts at similar levels of altitude.<br>
<br>
Similar heatmaps can be constructed for other industries based
on other measures of weather risk. The heatmaps can also be
used to compare regions in terms of the effects of climate
change on firms in a given industry.<br>

<li><a

heatmaps</a>.<br>
<br>
These heatmaps depict how the ski resorts' hotel businesses
adapt to an increase in weather risk by reducing their
operating leverage. We use a "movie" of heatmaps to show that
the firms change their behavior, - their inflexibility
decreases over time. This trend may be specific to the hotel
industry in ski resorts as an industry affected by climate
change in a particularly straightforward way.<br>
<br>
Similar heatmaps can be constructed for other industries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data behind the heatmaps are publicly available. Follow <a
href="https://github.com/alomper/RISKI/blob/master/data/district_year_data.csv">this
link</a> to obtain measures of the hotel businesses' weather
exposure (WE) and adaptation inflexibility (AI), adjusted for
the altitude of ski resorts. The first measure is depicted in
the exposure heatmap while the second is depicted in the
inflexibility heatmaps.</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/alomper/RISKI/blob/master/papers/klima_insolvenzen_fallstudie.pdf">Baumgartner
and Stomper (2020)</a> show that the heatmaps can be used to
predict the number of hospitality businesses filing for
bankruptcy in a given region. This is possible even though the
heapmaps are not based on any data about bankruptcies.</p>
